# Data Structures, Algorithms and programming exercises

This repository contains Data structures and Algorithms implementations in Kotlin (mostly) and Java that i have created when taking the course https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/

I also has several exercises solved (from leetcode, hackerrank, codewars etc) that are meant to train and improve my skills in software engineering.
